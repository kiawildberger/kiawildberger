### hello!

I'm Kai, a California-based student, writer, and full-stack developer. I want to use technology to promote genuine human connection that happens outside of apps, not in them.

Check out my interactive fiction [here](https://kiawildberger.github.io/lacueva), and my favorite project [here](https://kiawildberger.github.io/fantanosort).
